# capabilities — the system's map of itself (registry + curator)

Turns the 26 modules from a *collection* into a *system*: one self-describing
tree the rest can reason over.

```bash
python -m skills.capabilities.cli map               # ASCII layered system tree
python -m skills.capabilities.cli list --json       # the registry
python -m skills.capabilities.cli curate "test my desktop app"
```

## Layers (the arborescence)

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **SENSE** | understand project / cluster / task |
| **DECIDE** | route the work, cheapest capable |
| **ACT** | do the work, local-first |
| **REMEMBER** | capitalise (compounding) |
| **GOVERN** | consistency & cost control |
| **DEPLOY** | wire into projects & measure |

Each skill's layer comes from a `layer:` field in its SKILL.md frontmatter, else
a built-in map, else ACT. Generated snapshot: [`docs/system-map.txt`](../../docs/system-map.txt).

## The curator

`curate(goal)` ranks the capabilities most relevant to a goal (local lexical
match, **0 tokens**) — the librarian that hands the Conductor (and you) the right
branches of the tree to use. Built on [[skill-finder]].

This registry is the foundation for the Conductor (goal → decision tree → ordered
plan of capabilities, executed local-first) and the control loop (measure → adapt).
