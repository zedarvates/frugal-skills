Use when the user says 'do a complete checkup', 'botte doctor', after a component update, when onboarding to a project, or when multiple agents/devs may have caused drift."

# checkup — the canonical project checkup ("botte doctor")

So a "complete checkup" doesn't depend on you writing a good prompt: one command
runs the standard sequence in the right order and prints a single verdict, all
local / 0 cloud tokens.

```bash
python -m skills.checkup.cli            # current dir
python -m skills.checkup.cli <project> --json
python -m skills.checkup.cli . --pr-comment   # Markdown verdict for a PR comment
python -m skills.checkup.cli . --doctor       # + machine scan + ranked top-3 opportunities
python -m skills.checkup.cli . --doctor --fresh   # re-scan for local LLM backends (not cached)
```

## `--doctor` — the one-verb assembly

`--doctor` is `checkup` plus two things it doesn't otherwise do:

- **machine scan** — is a local LLM backend reachable (LM Studio/Ollama)? via
  [[llm-backends]] `audit()`; reads the cached registry unless `--fresh`.
- **ranked top-3 opportunities** — fixes from [[fix]] `find_fixes()`, ranked by
  estimated token cost (highest first), plus any remaining drift items, capped
  at 3.

Both feed a **one-line verdict**: `✅ sain` when there's no drift and a local
backend is active, or `⚠️ N optimisation(s), ~X tokens d'opportunités`
otherwise. Pure assembly of existing modules — no new skill, no new report format.

## Sequence (cheap → deeper)

1. **policy** — is `.botte/policy.md` committed? (shared rules for devs/agents)
2. **directives** — CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md health + stale path refs
3. **metrics** — LOC per component + always-on cost + savings framing
4. **infra** — hardware/software/MCP cluster tips (+ ASCII diagram)
5. **duplication** — stdlib AST duplicate-function scan
6. **security** — taint / data-flow scan ([[fallow-like]] `TaintAnalyzer`),
   CWE-tagged; high-severity findings become drift. 0 cloud tokens.
7. **docs review** — recurring Markdown due/current status from
   [[docs-steward]]. Never-reviewed bootstrap files are informational; an
   expired interval or explicitly watched content change becomes drift.
8. **knowledge integrity** — when a Wiki or second brain is detected, verify its
   structural maintenance contract and propose reviewable changes. P1/P2 gaps
   become drift; the audit remains read-only and makes no semantic-cleanliness claim.
9. **drift** — MCP wired? directives stale/oversized? policy missing? security?

Then points at the deep code audit (secrets/dead-code) for when you want it.

## Why

A component update or another dev/agent introduces **drift** — stale directives,
unwired MCP, an oversized CLAUDE.md, a missing policy. `/checkup` catches all of
it in one pass, with a fixed optimal procedure, instead of an ad-hoc prompt that
may be sub-optimal and may not prioritise local models.

## On pull requests

`--pr-comment` prints a verdict-first Markdown comment (carrying a stable marker
so a bot can edit it in place), **including the security section** — so the
taint/data-flow scan rides into CI for free. The `🧦 Botte Checkup (PR)` GitHub
Action (`.github/workflows/botte-pr-checkup.yml`) runs this on every PR and
posts/updates a single comment via `gh` — 0 cloud tokens, no extra dependencies.
Any project that deployed the toolkit can reuse the same workflow.
