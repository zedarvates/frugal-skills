description: "Route a high-level goal to an ordered, local-first plan of capabilities — the generalised router — and optionally EXECUTE the plan's read-only steps. Reads the capability registry/curator, composes steps ordered by the system's layers (SENSE→DECIDE→ACT→REMEMBER→GOVERN→DEPLOY), annotates each local vs cloud with a concrete command, and estimates the goal's effort. The executor runs the safe analysis steps unattended and confirm-gates anything that mutates state or escalates to the cloud. Use when the user states a goal and you need to decide which botte capabilities to use in what order (or run them), or asks 'how should I approach X with this toolkit'."

# conductor — goal → ordered plan of capabilities

The router, generalised: not "which model tier?" but "given this **goal**, which
capabilities, in which order, and what stays local?". The plan is the product —
you (or the agent) execute it; the Conductor never runs anything itself.

```bash
python -m skills.conductor.cli "test my desktop app and report crashes"
python -m skills.conductor.cli "reduce token cost and deploy on my project" --json

# Execute the plan (read-only steps run; mutating/cloud steps are gated):
python -m skills.conductor.cli "audit my project and report metrics" --execute
python -m skills.conductor.cli "..." --execute --dry-run      # preview, runs nothing
python -m skills.conductor.cli "..." --execute --confirm      # also run gated steps
```

## How it plans

1. **Curate** — picks the capabilities relevant to the goal ([[capabilities]]
   curator, local lexical match, 0 tokens).
2. **Order** — sorts them by the system's layers (SENSE → DECIDE → ACT →
   REMEMBER → GOVERN → DEPLOY): understand → decide → act → remember.
3. **Annotate** — each step gets a concrete command, a local/cloud flag, and the
   reason it's there.
4. **Estimate** — the goal's effort tier ([[auto-router]]) tells you whether any
   step's reasoning will escalate to the cloud.

Output: an ordered list of steps, **0 cloud tokens** to produce. It composes the
module collection into a coherent plan per goal — the conductor of the system.

## Executing the plan

The plan can be *run*, not just read. The executor classifies every step:

- **safe** — read-only analysis (`directives_audit`, `metrics`, `infra_advisor`,
  `checkup`, `cluster`, `llm_backends`) → runs unattended, 0 cloud tokens.
- **gated** — mutates state, generates artifacts, or escalates to the cloud →
  runs only with `--confirm` / `confirm=true`.
- **needs_args** — the command still has an unfilled `<placeholder>` → never runs.

`--dry-run` classifies everything and runs nothing (a preview). A failing step
yields a non-zero exit so CI can react. The runner is injectable, so the
behaviour is fully unit-tested without spawning subprocesses.

Exposed via [[llm-mcp]] as `conduct` (plan) and `execute_plan` (plan + run safe
steps). Built on [[capabilities]], [[auto-router]]; pairs with the [[control-loop]]
(measure savings → adapt the routing).

Each executor result also emits `agent_state` plus `agent_state_history` using
the backend-neutral `botte-agent-state-v1` contract. Safe work declares a read
scope while queued/working; gated work declares a conservative write scope.
Successful subprocesses become `completed` only after stable Git snapshots
provide revision-bound changed paths and exit validation; incomplete captures
remain `idle`.

Confirmed gated steps acquire one atomic mutation lease per Git root. An active
Botte writer prevents launch and returns `blocked_reason_code=conflict`; safe
read-only steps do not take the write lease.

A custom gated step may declare `mutation_scopes: ["build", "generated"]`.
Those bounded paths are observed directly, including Git-ignored files. An
unsafe or oversized scope blocks before launch or prevents a `completed` claim.
A Git-visible write outside those scopes fails the step even if its command
returns 0; `scope_violations` records the escaped paths without rolling them back.
This includes ignored files: a bounded metadata guard observes all paths outside
the declared scopes. If its initial evidence is incomplete, launch is blocked;
if final evidence is incomplete, the executed step fails without a completion claim.

The default runner also reports `process_containment`. It uses a Windows Job
Object or POSIX process group and closes that boundary before the final workspace
snapshot, preventing ordinary descendants from writing after an apparent success.
Injected test runners remain supported but are explicitly marked unverified.
With `--flow --task-run-id <id>`, the flow reuses the router's opaque task ID
and records a final efficiency verdict. Executed work is eligible for
`passed`/`failed` only when native process containment is attached; injected or
uncontained runners remain `unverified`.
